These are standardized responses for the Suricatoos Development Team to use when responding to Issues and Pull Requests. Using these templates helps maintain consistency in our communications and saves time.

Since GitHub currently does not support repository-wide saved replies, team members should maintain these individually. All responses are versioned for easier updates.

While these are templates, please customize them to fit the specific context and:
- Welcome new contributors
- Thank them for their contribution
- Provide context for your response
- Outline next steps
